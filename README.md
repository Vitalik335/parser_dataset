🌎 Open Data Web Scraper
This project is a web scraper designed to collect open data from government portals. It works for some websites, while others require a different approach due to their React-based architecture.

📌 Supported Websites
✅ 🇬🇧 data.gov.uk
✅ 🇦🇺 researchdata.edu.au
✅ 🇨🇦 search.open.canada.ca
✅ 🇳🇿 data.govt.nz
✅ 🇮🇪 data.gov.ie

Some websites use dynamic content loading with React, requiring a different scraping approach (e.g., Selenium or Puppeteer instead of BeautifulSoup).
